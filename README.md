# SpaceLog
We develop SpaceLog that employs log penalty within the framework of an earlier method space (Sparse PArtial Correlation Estimation). 
We show that the SpaceLog has good performance, particularly for networks with hubs. 
The R package is available to download and will be submitted to R Bioconductor as SpaceLog.
